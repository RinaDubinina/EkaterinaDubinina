Report 

Layers have already implemented:;

*Test implementation layer
*Test data layer
*Test run layer
*Configuration layer
*Utils layer

Layers have already missed:
*Test logic layer
*Service layer
*Report and logs layer

How could be current solution improved:
I can improve current solution by implementing missed layers.
Report and logs layer could be realised by Allure for reports and some log library.
Test logic layer could be realised by Cucumber.
Service layer could be realised if test data was in some database.
